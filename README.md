# LIRI
LIRI is a command line application built using Node. 
You will need to provide your own dotenv file with your Spotify API key to run this application.
The API keys you will need:
* Spotify
* BandsInTown
* OMDB

## How it Works
There are three commands you can use:
- concert-this
- movie-this
- spotify-this-song

After entering each command, follow it with whatever you want to search for. Below are example screenshots. <br>
(If nothing is entered for movie-this, it will default to searching for Mr. Nobody) <br>
(If nothing is entered for spotify-this-song, it will default to searching for The Sign by Ace of Base)
